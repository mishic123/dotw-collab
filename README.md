# Drawing on the Web - Assignment 4

## Version Control and Collaboration!

This project was an HTML and CSS project using music, gifs, and images to create a sort of drawing! The original creator chose to create a space themed project using Fleetwood Mac's "Never Going Back Again". This is a remixed version of that original project that involves new image assets, css animation, and the song "Sweet Disposition" by Temper Trap.
